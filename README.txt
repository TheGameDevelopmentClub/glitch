Our game was taken from how it is used in the genre of music called "Glitch Hop"
where the focus comes from the "aesthetics of failure", which is how we interpreted
the theme. In order to incorporate that we've chosen to make a game where one must
fail before they can succeed.

As for the voting categories, this is how it breaks down:


Programming
	The game was built in Monogame, which is the community built and open source
	version of XNA that has been maintained by third parties since it became
	unsupported by Microsoft. All code for this game was written by us by hand,
	including the physics handling, movement, controls, etc. The only other code
	included in this project is the libraries that are native to Monogame.
Art
	All  art from this game was also generated by our own hand using Gimp
Design
	The design centers around solving problems in unusual ways, and usually at some
	detriment to the character, though that may not always translate immediately 
	to the player...
Sound
	All sound, music, and sound effects were also generated, created, and pieced together
	respectively
